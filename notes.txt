HOTEL BOOKIGN 


Purpose:

The hotel reservation interface aims to provide users with a seamless booking experience, allowing them to select dates, choose from various room types, 
and receive immediate confirmation of their booking. It is designed to increase user engagement and streamline the reservation process.

Layout and Visual Elements:
Date Selection: Users are presented with a calendar interface where they can pick check-in and check-out dates for their stay.
Room Selection: A dynamic display showcases available rooms, categorized by type, with an option to view more details.
Booking Summary: A summary section provides users with a review of their booking details before final confirmation.
Availability Indicator: In cases where the desired room type is not available on selected dates, the interface will indicate the next available date.

Functionality:
Dynamic Date Picker: Users can choose two dates, the system should check availability in real-time and respond accordingly.
Room Availability Check: If no room is available for the selected dates, the system is intended to suggest alternative dates for the same room type on the selected floor.

Current State and Challenges:
Currently, the system only shows the 'Standard Room' option due to unforeseen technical issues.
The date selection component is not functioning as expected, and users are unable to book even the displayed 'Standard Room'.
The intended feature to suggest the next available date for full bookings is not operational.

Planned Features and Roadmap:

Date Selection Enhancement: The immediate priority is to fix the date selection tool for a fully functional date range picker.
Room Selection Expansion: Debug and expand the room selection functionality to display all room types and enable booking.
Booking Summary and Confirmation: Implement the summary view to confirm the booking details and provide users with a clear next step for reservation completion.
Availability Adjustments: Introduce a feature to automatically suggest the nearest available dates with a functional 'Book Room' button when the initial choice is not available.
